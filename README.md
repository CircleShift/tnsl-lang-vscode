# tnsl-lang

This extension provides basic language support and syntax highlighting for the TNSL programming language.

There are probably bugs but I want to get the actual language working before squashing them.  Put in an issue on github and I will take a look if you find any.  Basic highlighting is ok though, better than looking at solid color text at least.
